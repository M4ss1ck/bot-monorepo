# Tasks

When admin responds to a message with "/pb" the user is 
- banned from the group
- the message they sent is added to a blocklist in the group so if that same message is sent again its deleted by bot
- and that user ID and message is sent to me, the bot owner, where if I see the message is malicious I can permanently ban. This would ban them from any group where they join and this bot is admin
